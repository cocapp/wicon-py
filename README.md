## [SEE BELOW FOR DEBIAN-LIKE] Steps to run:
1.  Install the Python dependencies in your local environment:

    ```sh
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you intend to also develop, also installing developer dependencies might be useful to you:
    ```sh
    python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    ```


2.  Set up your credentials using the `addcreds` command. You may later use the same command to edit (overwrite) your credentials.
    
    ```sh
    python ./login_cli.py addcreds
    ```
    
    Example usage:
    ```sh
    $ python ./login_cli.py addcreds
    Enter your register number: 21BEE8964
    Enter your password:
    Credentials added successfully.
    ```

    The echo is turned off when entering the password, and it is normal for no text to be displayed.

3.  Run the script to login:

    ```sh
    python ./login_cli.py login
    ```

    You may optionally supply your credentials as an argument:

    ```sh
    python ./login_cli.py login -r 21BEE8964 -p "my unguessable password"
    ```

4. When you're done using the internet, logout.

    ```sh
    python ./login_cli.py logout
    ```


## [FOR DEBIAN-LIKE] Steps to run:
1.  Run the following command. You must have `curl` and `python3` in installed and in your system path. You must also have `sudo` privileges.
    
    ```sh
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocapp/wicon-py/master/setup.sh | bash
    ```

    When prompted, enter a sudo password. This is required to install WiCon in the network manager.

2.  When prompted, enter your VIT Wi-Fi credentials. These will be stored in your home directory in a file called `.wicon`. You may later edit this file to change your credentials, or reuse the `addcreds` command.
